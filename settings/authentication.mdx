Mintlify supports single sign-on to your dashboard via SAML and OIDC. If you use Okta, we have provider-specific documentation for setting up SSO, but if you use another provider, please contact us!

<Note>
  SSO functionality is still in beta! Please reach out to [support](mailto:support@mintlify.com) to enable this functionality.
